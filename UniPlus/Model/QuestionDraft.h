/**
 The data model for saving a draft.
 
 Each time when a user dismiss a PostQuestionTableViewController, the draft will be automatically saved.
 
  - If there is no drafts, then it will initialize a new questionDrafts array, then store the current draft.
  - If the user has a draft composed previously, then append the current draft to the array.
  - If the user successfully posts this draft, then it will be deleted from the array.
  - If the user makes any changes to the draft, then it will be considered as a new draft.
 
 @warning *This is only used to store the draft within the application lifecycle!*
